# How to Add Replay Examples to Your Gameplan Files

This guide shows you how to add Pokemon Showdown replay examples to your gameplan markdown files so they appear in the app.

## Format

Add a "Replay Examples" section to your gameplan markdown file using this format:

```markdown
## Replay Examples

### vs [Opponent Team Name]
**Replay:** https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen9vgc2025-[REPLAY_ID]
**Notes:** Brief description of what happened in this game and key moments.

### vs [Another Opponent Team]
**Replay:** https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen9vgc2025-[REPLAY_ID]
**Notes:** Brief description of what happened in this game and key moments.
```

## Example

Here's a real example from the sample files:

```markdown
## Replay Examples

### vs Calyrex-Ice + Amoonguss
**Replay:** [Replace with actual Pokemon Showdown replay URL]
**Notes:** Perfect execution of the gameplan. Koraidon OHKO'd their Calyrex-Ice on turn 1, Tornadus successfully prevented Trick Room with Taunt. Key moment: Turn 2 Flare Blitz on their back was crucial for momentum.

### vs Speed Control Teams
**Replay:** [Replace with actual Pokemon Showdown replay URL]
**Notes:** Won the speed control war. Our Tornadus got Tailwind up first, then used Taunt to prevent their Tornadus from setting up. Koraidon swept through their team after speed control was established.
```

## How to Get Replay URLs

1. Go to [Pokemon Showdown](https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/)
2. Play a game or find a replay you want to reference
3. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar
4. The URL will look like: `https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen9vgc2025-[YOUR_REPLAY_ID]`

## Tips

- Use descriptive matchup names (e.g., "vs Calyrex-Ice + Amoonguss" instead of just "vs Trick Room")
- Keep notes brief but include key moments or strategies that worked
- Add 2-3 replay examples per gameplan file
- Make sure the replay URLs are valid and accessible

## Where to Place

Add the "Replay Examples" section near the end of your gameplan file, after your gameplans but before any "Notes" or "What Threatens This Team" sections.

The replay examples will appear in the app when you select a matchup, showing users how to find and reference Pokemon Showdown replays for that specific matchup.
